# Bad Apple!! MBR

This is the source code of the Bad Apple!! MBR. This code allows you to play "Bad Apple!!" with synchronized audio in MBR. Except of course there is data beyond MBR sector.

## WARNING BAD AUDIO

Due to not finding a good MIDI file, the best available one was used. However, it is still not perfect, and therefore the sound quality is bad.
